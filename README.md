LRPHackerTyper Version 2
A generic HackerTyper program 

** What is it? ** 

A program that allows the user to hit the keyboard however instead of the specific keys that are pressed appearing on the screen, the contents of a text file (code.txt) are printed to screen instead.
The user just needs to mash the keys and th contents appear without any errors. 

Added into this are a set of Hot Keys. Hitting these 3 (three) times in a row will trigger a pop up message box. 
These hot keys can be found on 'Keyboard Shortcuts.txt'
Hitting escape will clear the pop ups. 

** Amending the Code **
I have tried to make it clear how to add to this code. 
See the comments within the 'Script.js' file for details. 
Any problems please contact me. 

** Changes from Version 1 **
This version differs from Version 1 in the following ways:
  1. It is limited to only TEN (10) hot keys. These are the numbers 1 to 0 on the main keyboard.
  2. Escape still clears pop ups
  3. The concept here was having multiple HackerTypers for different purposes. Have a different 'code.txt' file and amend the CSS to adjust to formatting etc.

This was distributed under a creative commons licence

I have added to the code, however broadly the actual look and feel of th code remains unchanged.
I expect no payment for the code and allow it to be passed on so long as it is done so free of charge.


** Legally Bits ** 
This is not my strong point. I am likely to mess this up. My intention is to release this so that you can take it, use it, copy it, amend it, and improve on it. If you do improve on it, please let me know!!
